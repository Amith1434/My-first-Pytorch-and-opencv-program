# My-first-Pytorch-and-opencv-program
I am learning to use pytorch

This project uses PyTorch and OpenCV to perform real-time object detection using a webcam.

It can detect and label everyday objects such as person, pen, bottle, phone, and more â€” all powered by a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model.

This code is AI-generated and improved as I'm still learning this on my own.
